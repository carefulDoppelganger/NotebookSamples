    "**IPO** stands for initial public offering, and refers to the process of a private corporation offering their shares to the public through a new stock issuance. This means transitioning ownership, which is why the IPO process can be known as “going public”. IPOs are important since they provide companies with an opportunity to get capital by offering their shares through the primary market. By selling shares to the public, the company can raise funds that can be used for various purposes, such as expanding operations, paying off debt, or funding research and development. The process of going public involves many regulatory requirements, some of which are done through the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the U.S. Once the IPO process is completed, the company's shares are listed on a stock exchange. One example of this is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ. This listing allows the shares to be traded among investors in the secondary market. The price of the shares fluctuates based on the supply and demand in the open market and not all IPOs result in a successful investment, which is why analyzing their recent performance is important for determining good investment opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IPOs can be interesting to study and invest in due to their growth potential, access to new opportunities, liquidity, and potential for early gains**. However, they also come with risks and challenges, and investors should conduct thorough research and consider their risk tolerance before participating in IPOs. **In this notebook, we will explore the viability of investing in companies that have gone public  recently using the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology.**"

    "There are many variables involved in evaluating the performance of an IPO. Since we are interested in predicting whether the companies are good investment opportunities, we will be looking at the **share price % change of previous days**, **news sentiment scores** and **sale volume** to predict the **forecasted share price % change** and thus determine investment viability. \n",
    "\n",
    "The descriptions for our features are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Forecasted Share Price % Change (**Depedent/Response variable**): This feature describes the anticipated or projected percentage change in the share price of the IPO in the future. It will be determined by inputting all of the independent variables we covered above into our\n",
    "model, for each of the 5 recent tech companies which we’ve selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "- % Change of Previous Day Share Price (**Independent/Explanatory variable**): This feature describes the percentage change in the price\n",
    "of IPO shares by comparing the current price (or closing price) of a share to a previous price. A positive value for the % change would indicate an increase in the share price compared to the previous price, while a negative value would indicate a decrease in the share price compared to the previous one. This is particularly valuable for assessing short-term performance of IPO shares and helps determine investment viability since it tracks the movement of the share price.\n",
    "\n",
    "- News Sentiment Score (**Independent/Explanatory variable**): This feature describes the sentiment around an IPO and company going public, including market sentiment, investor sentiment, and public perception. Our study will assess sentiment score based on media coverage by news articles and press releases about our selected IPOs and assign them to categories ranging from Bullish (indicating a positive outlook about the IPOs shares by investors) to Bearish (indicating a pessimistic or skeptical outlook about the IPO shares by investors). These designations are an important part of assessing investment opportunities since Bullish sentiment can indicate a higher initial offering price and strong demand for shares, compared to the lower pricing and weaker demand indicated by Bullish sentiment, thus providing perspective on whether an IPO may be considered a good investment opportunity.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Below, we’ve included a chart showing the sentiment score range of values as relevant to their sentiment labels:\n",
    "\n",
    "    | Range           | Sentiment Score      |\n",
    "    |-----------------|-----------------------|\n",
    "    | x ≤ -0.35       | Bearish               |\n",
    "    | -0.35 < x ≤ -0.15 | Somewhat-Bearish    |\n",
    "    | -0.15 < x < 0.15  | Neutral             |\n",
    "    | 0.15 ≤ x < 0.35   | Somewhat Bullish    |\n",
    "    | x ≥ 0.35         | Bullish               |\n",
    "\n",
    "    Table 1: Sentiment Score Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sales Volume (**Independent/Explanatory variable**): This feature describes the total number of shares of a company’s stock that have been bought and sold on a stock exchange within a specific time frame. This is a key factor in determining IPO performance since it can indicate how actively investors are trading the stock and is used alongside other metrics to assess the market sentiment around IPOs, therefore making it an important way to determine investment viability\n",
